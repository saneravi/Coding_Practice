Create SSH keys on Linux using ssh-keygen

First of all, let’s have a look at creating SSH keys on Linux operating systems.
To create SSH keys on Linux, use the ssh-keygen command with a RSA algorithm:;;

cd ~/.ssh/ && ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/schkn/.ssh/id_rsa): "custom_id_rsa"
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): "......."
Enter same passphrase again: ".............."

Configure your SSH keys

sudo nano ~/.ssh/config

Host *
    Hostname github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/"custom_id_rsa"

Add SSH key to your GitHub Account
In order to add a SSH key to your GitHub account, head over to the settings of your account and select the “SSH and GPG keys” option in the left menu. click on the “New SSH key” button in order to create a new SSH key for Github.

To get the content of your public key on Linux, use the cat command on your public key file.

cat ~/.ssh/"custom_id_rsa".pub

Paste the content of your public key to the dedicated key text area on GitHub.
Click on “Add SSH key” in order to complete the process.
Congratulations, you have successfully added your SSH keys to GitHub.


PART 2

The first thing to be done is the creation of a new repository on GitHub.

Click Create Repository and GitHub will do it's thing. The address of the new repository will be:
https://github.com/USER/PROJECTNAME.git​

On your local machine, create a new project folder. Go to the folder, open terminal.

Initialize the repository with the command:
git init

Now let's create a readme file with the command:
touch readme.txt

Add the new file to the staging area with the command:
git add .

To create the commit, issue the command:
git commit -m "added readme"

You can change the text in quotes to be whatever you want, such as "my first commit." Make sure the text in quotes describes what's been done for the commit.

The next step will make use of the GitHub repository address. What we need to do is add the local repository to the origin (the name of the remote repository where you want to publish your commits) of the remote repository. This is done with the command:

git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/PROJECTNAME.git

At this point you can then push your work to the remote with the command:

git push -u origin master
